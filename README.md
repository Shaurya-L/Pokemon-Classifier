# Pokemon-Classifier

In this project we classify various different types of Pokemon from generation 1 which are Pikachu, Balbasur, etc. The entire code has been explained explicitly by writing comments. Also the link to download the dataset has been mentioned in the file itself.

We have built a 4 layer VGG model which gives us a testing accuracy of about 93.2%.

Feel free to clone and download the repositry. In case something isn't clear feel free to contact me at **shauryaluthra689@gmail.com**
